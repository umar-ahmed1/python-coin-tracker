# python-coin-tracker
Quick python script to track the live price of any dexscreener coin and profit/loss given a purchase price, built for fun for a friend as crypto wallets do not live update often

To use, update the coin URL in the code
download all packages required using `%pip install PACKAGE_NAME`
run the notebook
In the GUI enter your price and number of coins, and click start tracking
